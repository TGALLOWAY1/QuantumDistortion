# Quantum Distortion (MVP)



Experimental DSP engine combining spectral pitch quantization with time-domain distortion.



MVP features:

- Load audio files

- Process through pre-quant → distortion → post-quant → limiter

- Visualize tap points (spectrum, oscilloscope, phase scope)



This MVP is a Python prototype intended to validate the DSP design before building a JUCE VST plugin.
