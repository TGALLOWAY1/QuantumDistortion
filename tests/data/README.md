# Test Audio Fixtures

This directory contains short, synthetic test fixtures generated by `scripts/generate_test_fixtures.py`.

These fixtures are used for:
- Regression testing of the audio processing pipeline
- Listening tests to verify audio quality
- Performance benchmarking
- Integration tests

All fixtures are generated synthetically using Python + NumPy, making them:
- Easy to version control (script is versioned, not large audio files)
- Reproducible across environments
- Deterministic and consistent

## Expected Files

The following files are generated by `scripts/generate_test_fixtures.py`:

- **`sub_sweep.wav`**: 5 seconds, frequency sweep from ~30 Hz to ~120 Hz. Useful for testing frequency-dependent processing and quantization behavior across the sub-bass range.

- **`wobble_bass.wav`**: 5 seconds, a simple bass tone with LFO-like amplitude modulation. Tests how the pipeline handles time-varying amplitude and bass frequencies.

- **`kick_sub_combo.wav`**: Alternating pattern of short "kick" bursts and sustained sub tones. Tests transient handling and the interaction between percussive and sustained elements.

- **`midrange_growl_like.wav`**: A midrange tone with basic distortion/modulation to mimic a "growl-ish" texture. Tests processing of harmonically rich, modulated signals in the midrange.

## Regenerating Fixtures

To regenerate all fixtures, run:

```bash
python scripts/generate_test_fixtures.py
```

This will overwrite existing fixture files. The script uses deterministic generation, so the output should be identical across runs.
